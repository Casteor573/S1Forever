  <!-- i kind of want to make a Subtypes section but i'm not sure..
       only the first bit in the prop val does anything
       in the scene, however, most platforms have their top bit set
       it looks like it did something in the original game, but it doesn't mean much in 2013
       so.. should we include that bit in the subtypes, even if it does nothing? or do we just want 00/01 as subtypes and not 80/81.. i'm not sure
       for now i'll stick with 00/01, but maybe i'll change it in the future?-->
